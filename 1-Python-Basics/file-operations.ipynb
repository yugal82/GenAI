    "'r+': Read and write mode. Opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",

    "#### Append Modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "'a': Append-only mode. Adds new data to the end of the file. Creates the file if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a+': Append and read mode. Opens the file for both appending and reading. Creates the file if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "'b': Binary mode. Used for non-text files (e.g., images, audio). Can be combined with other modes like 'rb', 'wb', 'ab', etc."
